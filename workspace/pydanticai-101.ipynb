    "PydanticAI is an innovative, Python-based framework developed by the creators of Pydantic, designed to build reliable, structured, and type-safe AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional prompt-centric AI development, PydanticAI introduces a schema-first, developer-centric approach that ensures LLM responses are predictable, validated, and aligned with strongly typed Python models.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of PydanticAI is the idea of treating AI agents as strongly typed functions. Developers define the inputs and outputs of their agents using standard Pydantic models, and the framework ensures that all AI responses conform to these constraints. This tight integration between LLM reasoning and Python typing empowers developers to build robust agents without the uncertainty and fragility commonly associated with free-form LLM outputs.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here in this guided project, we are building a customer support chatbot using PydanticAI, trained on Kaggle's customer support ticket dataset. The chatbot uses structured schemas to classify user queries into categories, assign priority levels, escalate where necessary, and generate consistent, professional responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a practical, real-world application that highlights how to turn raw AI potential into operational excellence—all using type-safe models and modular agent design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you’re building support bots, legal agents, data annotators, or AI workflow chains, PydanticAI empowers you to build with confidence, clarity, and control—without compromising on the power of LLMs.\n"

    "# What is PydanticAI?\n",
    "PydanticAI is a powerful open-source Python framework built to simplify the process of developing production-ready applications using Generative AI (GenAI), such as Large Language Models (LLMs). \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s designed for developers who want to create smart AI agents and applications that are structured, maintainable, and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why was PydanticAI created?\n",
    "In the world of Python, Pydantic is widely used for data validation and settings management, and FastAPI made web development faster and cleaner by building on top of Pydantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the team behind Pydantic started using LLMs in their own tool called Logfire, they noticed a gap — there wasn’t any agent framework that provided the same smooth experience that FastAPI offered for APIs. Most existing LLM tools were either too complex, too loosely structured, or hard to manage at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they built PydanticAI with one goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Bring the developer-friendly experience of FastAPI to the world of GenAI apps.”\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Features of PydanticAI:\n",
    "1. Agent-Oriented Design: Agents are central to PydanticAI, acting as containers that manage prompts, tools, and structured outputs, facilitating complex workflows and multi-agent interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Type Safety and Validation: Leveraging Pydantic's robust type system, it ensures data integrity and clarity in agent behaviors, reducing runtime errors.​\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model-Agnostic Compatibility: Supports various LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Deepseek, Ollama, Groq, Cohere, and Mistral, with a straightforward interface for integrating additional models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Integration with Pydantic Logfire: Offers seamless debugging, performance monitoring, and behavior tracking, enhancing the observability of LLM-powered applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Python-Centric Approach: Emphasizes familiar Python control flows and best practices, making it accessible for developers to build and maintain AI-driven projects.\n",
