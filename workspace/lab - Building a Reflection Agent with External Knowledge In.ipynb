[...] Open Access ISSN: 2153-0769 Metabolomics: Open Access Mini Review Volume 14:02, 2024 Abstract The concept of an evolutionary diet suggests that human bodies are best adapted to the foods our ancestors consumed during the Paleolithic era. Advocates of this dietary approach argue that modern eating habits contribute to various health issues, including declines in body composition. This article explores the evolutionary diet theory and its potential effects on body composition, discussing both its [...] advent of agriculture. This dietary approach posits that modern human health issues, including declines in body composition, can be attributed to a mismatch between our genetic makeup and our contemporary diet. Central to the evolutionary diet is the idea that humans evolved to eat certain types of foods over millions of years of evolution. Proponents argue that the shift from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled agricultural societies introduced novel foods, such as grains and dairy, which\", \"score\": 0.7982658}, {\"title\": \"The evolution of human nutrition: Current Biology - Cell Press\", \"url\": \"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(13)00363-1\", \"content\": \"might be interested to know how selection has shaped human dietary needs and adaptability, nevertheless their core concern is the public health problem of ensuring nutritional adequacy.

      "{'answer': 'A high-quality, nutrient-dense breakfast rooted in evolutionary biology should focus on animal-based foods, particularly organ meats like liver and heart, eggs, and oxidative-rich seafood. These foods provide highly bioavailable vitamins (A, D, B12), essential minerals (iron, zinc, selenium), and complete proteins, crucial for energy, immunity, and metabolic health. Organ meats are especially nutrient-dense, often outperforming plant sources in bioavailability and micronutrient content (e.g., heme iron), and lack antinutrients like phytates and oxalates that impair mineral absorption and may cause toxicity.\\n\\nConventional wisdom emphasizing fiber for gut health does not align with human evolutionary evidence, which suggests humans thrived on animal foods with minimal plant fiber intake. Excess dietary fiber can disrupt gut microbiota and lead to dysbiosis (Ferrario et al., 2020). The carnivore protocol demonstrates that humans can thrive on animal diets, often with marked reductions in inflammatory markers and improved metabolic parameters.\\n\\nThus, prioritizing organ meats and animal foods optimizes nutrient bioavailability and aligns with our evolutionary design, eliminating the risks associated with plant antinutrients and non-essential fiber intake.', 'reflection': {'missing': 'Detailed mechanistic data linking specific plant antinutrients to adverse health effects, and biomarkers measuring nutrient bioavailability differences.', 'superfluous': \"Extended discussion on phytochemicals' beneficial effects, which may not be supported by high-quality evidence.\"}, 'search_queries': ['antinutrients in plants bioavailability', 'evolutionary nutrition and human diet', 'benefits of organ meats and animal foods']}\n"

            "answer": "While I am not a financial advisor, I can share insights on the benefits of animal-based nutrition. When considering lifestyle choices, focusing on nutrient-dense, bioavailable foods derived from animals—such as organ meats, eggs, and meat—provides essential vitamins and minerals in a form readily utilized by the human body. This is rooted in our evolutionary history, where early humans relied heavily on animal foods for survival and optimal health. In the context of investment or housing decisions, the principle of prioritizing highly bioavailable, nature-designed nutrients aligns with the idea that human health flourishes when supported by the foods our physiology has adapted to consume.\n\nContrasting this with the notion of relying heavily on processed plant foods, which contain anti-nutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates, raises questions about their long-term safety and impact. These plant defense compounds evolved to deter herbivores and are often found to cause inflammation, impair nutrient absorption, or contribute to chronic health issues. From an evolutionary perspective, human exposure to these compounds was limited in scope and quantity; modern diets rich in processed plants often exceed what our physiology can handle.\n\nIn sum, when making choices about your environment—be it home or diet—consider that nature designed animal foods as the optimal source of bioavailable nutrients without the deleterious plant compounds. This framework supports building resilience and health, aligning with our evolutionary blueprint.",

            "answer": "Reflecting on the above, it's clear that human evolution strongly supports animal-based nutrition due to its superior bioavailability and nutrient density, especially in organ meats and other animal products. This approach minimizes the intake of plant antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates, which can interfere with nutrient absorption and cause inflammation. Challenging the conventional narrative that fiber and plant foods are necessary for health, the evidence indicates that humans thrived on animal diets for millions of years before the advent of agriculture. The carnivore diet exemplifies this, emphasizing elimination of plant compounds that may be harmful in excess. Critically, a focus on ancestral eating patterns aligns with evolutionary biology, which shows that our physiology is optimized for animal foods. While environmental and economic decisions, such as buying or selling a home, depend on additional market factors, prioritizing health through an animal-based diet remains consistent with our biological design.",

This is rooted in our evolutionary history, where early humans relied heavily on animal foods for survival and optimal health.

In contrast, plant foods contain antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates, which are natural defense compounds that can impair nutrient absorption and cause inflammation when consumed excessively.

      "From an animal-based nutrition perspective, the decision to buy or sell a home should be based on personal financial circumstances, market analysis, and economic indicators, which are outside the scope of biological science. However, focusing on diet, humans have evolved to thrive on nutrient-dense, highly bioavailable foods from animals—including organ meats, eggs, and meat—supporting optimal health, metabolic flexibility, and resilience. In contrast, plant foods contain antinutrients such as oxalates, lectins, and phytates, which can impair nutrient absorption and promote inflammation. These compounds are evolutionary plant defense chemicals, often problematic in excess, and our ancestors consumed them in limited quantities. A diet centered on animal foods aligns with our evolutionary blueprint, providing essential nutrients without the negative effects associated with plant antinutrients. While real estate decisions depend on market trends, dietary choices rooted in evolutionary biology promote individual health and robustness.\n",

      "Intermediate Step 1:\n",
      "Reflecting on the above, it's clear that human evolution strongly supports animal-based nutrition due to its superior bioavailability and nutrient density, especially in organ meats and other animal products. This approach minimizes the intake of plant antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates, which can interfere with nutrient absorption and cause inflammation. Challenging the conventional narrative that fiber and plant foods are necessary for health, the evidence indicates that humans thrived on animal diets for millions of years before the advent of agriculture. The carnivore diet exemplifies this, emphasizing elimination of plant compounds that may be harmful in excess. Critically, a focus on ancestral eating patterns aligns with evolutionary biology, which shows that our physiology is optimized for animal foods. While environmental and economic decisions, such as buying or selling a home, depend on additional market factors, prioritizing health through an animal-based diet remains consistent with our biological design.\n",
