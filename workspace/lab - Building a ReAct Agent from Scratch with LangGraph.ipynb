    "In this lab, you'll explore the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent framework, which combines reasoning and action in language models to solve complex problems. You'll learn how to implement a ReAct agent from scratch using LangChain and LangGraph, starting with simple reasoning patterns and progressing to more complex implementations with tool usage. By the end of the lab, you'll understand how ReAct agents interleave thinking and acting to tackle multi-step problems that require external information or computation.\n"

    "## What is a ReAct Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct is an agent framework that combines reasoning and acting within large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems through a structured approach. Unlike standard language models that generate responses in a single pass, ReAct agents follow an iterative process that alternates between thinking and taking actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components of ReAct\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reasoning** – The agent thinks through the problem, considering what it knows and what it needs to find out.  \n",
    "2. **Acting** – Based on its reasoning, the agent selects and executes an appropriate action or tool.  \n",
    "3. **Observing** – The agent receives feedback based on the action (that is, tool output).  \n",
    "4. **Further Reasoning** – The agent incorporates observations into its reasoning process.  \n",
    "5. **Repeat or Conclude** – The agent either takes another action or concludes with an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes ReAct powerful is the continuous feedback loop between reasoning and action, allowing the agent to gather information incrementally and adapt its approach as new information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the following image to illustrate the ReAct framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot 2025-04-17 at 12.51.55 PM.png](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/d2zMISxLwsKW7FkIftP-gQ/Screenshot%202025-04-17%20at%2012-51-55%E2%80%AFPM.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "When a query is received, it is passed to the LLM, which begins reasoning about how to address it. If the query requires information beyond the LLM’s internal knowledge—such as real-time data or external resources—the LLM identifies this gap and decides to interact with the external environment (represented by the \"Environment\" box in the diagram) to retrieve the missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the LLM decides to call a tool (such as a calculator, a web search function, or a database lookup). That tool interacts with the environment, retrieves the required information, and returns it to the LLM. This is shown by the arrows connecting tools and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM then observes the result, reasons again, and may repeat this process—calling additional tools if needed—until it has enough information to conclude with a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the LLM does not simply guess—it thinks, acts, observes, and iterates as needed, making it more reliable, dynamic, and capable.\n"

    "## Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning is the foundation of ReAct agents. Language models can perform explicit reasoning, and one of the simplest yet most powerful ways to enhance their performance on complex tasks is just to ask them to think step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain of Thought (CoT)** prompting was one of the first effective techniques developed for this. The core idea is simple: rather than asking the model for an answer directly, you guide it to reason step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "CoT prompting isn't about telling the model what to think but showing it how to think. By providing examples that walk through the reasoning process, you're effectively teaching the model to mimic that kind of logical thinking in its own responses.\n",
    "\n",

    "   5. When you have enough information, provide your final answer.\n",
