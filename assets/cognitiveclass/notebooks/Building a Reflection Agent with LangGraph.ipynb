You'll start by understanding the concept of reflection in AI, then build a complete reflection agent that can generate content, evaluate its quality, and refine outputs through multiple iterations. Working with a LinkedIn post generator as your example, you'll implement a graph-based workflow that mimics human-like reflective thinking, enabling the agent to transform basic content into polished, engaging outputs. By the end of this project, you'll have hands-on experience creating AI systems that can think critically about their own work and continuously improve their
