That tool interacts with the environment, retrieves the required information, and returns it to the LLM. This is shown by the arrows connecting tools and the environment.\n","\n","The LLM then observes the result, reasons again, and may repeat this process—calling additional tools if needed—until it has enough information to conclude with a final answer.\n","\n","In short, the LLM does not simply guess—it thinks, acts, observes, and iterates as needed, making it more reliable, dynamic, and capable.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"31c9b19c-055d-4e0b-b2e8-10cdf911fb83","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Reasoning\n","\n","Reasoning is the foundation of ReAct agents.
